# Folder Structure

When organizing the folder structure for a university academic course registration system using PHP MVC, it's important to keep the codebase well-organized and modular. Here's a suggested folder structure that includes directories for CSS, JS, HTML, database, PHP, and reporting:

1. Root Folder:
   - index.php (Entry point for the application)

2. CSS:
   - style.css (CSS files for styling the application)

3. JS:
   - script.js (JavaScript files for client-side functionality)

4. HTML:
   - templates (HTML templates for the views)

5. Database:
   - migrations (Database migration scripts)
   - seeds (Seed data for the database)

6. PHP:
   - app:
     - controllers (Controller classes)
     - models (Model classes)
     - views (View classes)
     - helpers (Helper functions)

   - config:
     - database.php (Database configuration)

   - routes:
     - web.php (Route definitions)

   - bootstrap.php (Application bootstrapping and initialization)

7. Reporting:
   - reports (Generated reports)

This folder structure follows the principles of the PHP MVC pattern and separates different components of the system:

- The `CSS` directory contains CSS files that handle the styling of the application.
- The `JS` directory contains JavaScript files for client-side functionality, such as form validation or dynamic UI updates.
- The `HTML` directory holds HTML templates for the views. These templates can be used by the View classes to generate dynamic content.
- The `Database` directory includes folders for database-related tasks. The `migrations` folder contains scripts for managing database schema changes, and the `seeds` folder contains seed data for populating the database with initial values.
- The `PHP` directory is further divided into several subdirectories:
  - The `app/controllers` directory contains the Controller classes responsible for handling user requests and interacting with the models.
  - The `app/models` directory contains the Model classes that represent the data and handle database interactions.
  - The `app/views` directory holds the View classes responsible for generating the HTML output to be presented to the users.
  - The `app/helpers` directory can contain helper functions or utility classes used across the application.
  - The `config` directory stores configuration files, such as the `database.php` file that contains the database connection details.
  - The `routes` directory contains route definition files, such as `web.php`, which maps URLs to specific controllers and actions.
  - The `bootstrap.php` file is responsible for bootstrapping the application, initializing necessary components, and setting up any required dependencies.

- The `Reporting` directory is for storing generated reports. This can include any reports generated by the system, such as enrollment reports or course statistics.

This folder structure provides a modular and organized approach to building the university academic course registration system using PHP MVC. It separates different concerns and allows for easier navigation and maintenance of the codebase.
