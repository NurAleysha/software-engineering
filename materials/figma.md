## Description
Behance, part of Adobe, is the leading online platform to showcase & discover creative work. Creative people around the world join Behance, entering a community made with their original work and creative process in mind.

## Projects
A [Project](https://help.behance.net/hc/en-us/articles/204483644-What-is-a-Project-) is a grouping of images, videos, and other digital content with a related theme or process. Every project has a unique URL that can be shared across the web, as well as a View and Appreciation counter so you can track how many people have seen your project and given you kudos on a job well done. Here is an [example of a Project](https://www.behance.net/gallery/60441657/Behance-Year-in-Review-2017-Our-10-Year-Anniversary) created by the Behance Design Team.

## Following Profiles
Behance members can **Follow** your profile and you can, in turn, follow other users. When you Follow someone, their updates (projects they‚Äôve uploaded, Appreciated, or Added to a Moodboard) appear in your **For You** feed.

## For You Feed
The [For You](https://help.behance.net/hc/en-us/articles/204484454-What-is-the-For-You-feed-) feed is the home screen for signed-in Behance creatives. As you follow more profiles, you'll start to see more projects appear in your feed. To view a Project that appears in your For You feed, simply click the Project Cover and the full contents of the project will open for you to view.
