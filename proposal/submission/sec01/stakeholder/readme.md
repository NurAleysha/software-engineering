### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Accommodation System for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) addresses the challenges students and staff face when managing and applying for student accommodation. The existing housing application and management process must be more time-consuming and integrated because it can cause delays, mistakes, and dissatisfaction for students and staff.

As a result, the proposed web application software system will offer a website where students can request accommodations, make payments, and check the status of their requests. KTDI administrator will be able to manage room availability and allocation and access relevant data and reports through a centralized dashboard. At the same time, the regular staff will be able to manage all of the applications submitted by the students via the website developed, and the fellow could also control KTDI merits throughout this system. In terms of maintenance, it is guaranteed that KTDI rooms will remain in good condition owing to the maintenance request and tracking functionality of the proposed accommodation system, giving students a comfortable and secure living environment.
The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and prompts throughout the process. It will also incorporate automated communication channels, such as email notifications, to keep students updated on the status of their applications and requests.

The project's expected outcomes include improved students and KTDI staff satisfaction, as the software system will provide a more convenient and streamlined process for managing and applying accommodation. KTDI staff will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for manual data entry and administrative tasks. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the accommodation application process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall.

### 2. Background
Managing student accommodations in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) is a complex and challenging task. The current process is less flexible for students and KTDI staffs when managing room applications, allocations, and rent payments is vulnerable, inconsistencies, and time-consuming for both students and KTDI staffs. Students face difficulties in selecting suitable rooms based on their preferences and accessibility, while KTDI staffs struggle with the workload of managing hundreds of applications and allocating rooms manually.

To solve these issues, we propose a modern and intuitive Student Accommodation System that automates the room selection process, from application to allocation, and provides a seamless experience for students and KTDI staffs. With the use of the latest technology and industry best practices, the system aims to simplify the process of applying for hostels online, selecting preferred rooms, and allocating suitable accommodations based on student preferences and accessibility needs.

The proposed system includes several key features, such as a user-friendly interface that integrates with other university systems like billing and student information, enhanced data analysis capabilities, and features that enable tracking maintenance requests, scheduling repairs and replacements, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations. These features aim to improve the overall management and maintenance of student accommodations, creating a comfortable and safe living environment for students and enhancing their academic success and overall well-being.

The Student Accommodation System will also bring significant benefits to the students also KTDI staffs, such as increased efficiency, time-saving, and reduced errors during the allocation process. The online application process will simplify the application process for students, making it easier and more convenient for them to select their preferred rooms. The enhanced data analysis capabilities will provide administrators with insights into occupancy rates, student preferences, and college merits, enabling them to make informed decisions about future room allocation. The maintenance system will ensure that the rooms remains well-maintained, creating a comfortable and safe living environment for students.

In summary, the proposed Student Accommodation System aims to streamline the room rental process in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), improving the student experience and providing administrators with more effective working operations. By automating the allocation process, enhancing data analysis capabilities, and improving maintenance systems, the system will create a more strategic and efficient approach to managing student accommodations, enhancing the reputation of the university, and promoting student academic success and overall well-being.

### 4. Scope
The scope refers to the boundaries of the project and outlines the features and functionalities of the system, including its goals, objectives and requirements as well as the expected outcomes and benefits. Detailed explanations of the features and functionality of our proposed student accommodation system in KTDI are as follows:

- User registration: <br>By entering personal information and setting up a password with UTM ID, new user can register as our website user before using the KTDI system.

- Centralised Dashboard: <br>In both the user interfaces of the students, fellows, KTDI staff and also the adminstrative department or KTDI department will have a well looking dashboard to provide the users a easier and effective way to access their needs via the tools provided. The dashboard can provide students with current allocated college merits, college activities, personal information and hostel information such as dormitory fees according to room type, room location and hostel block.

- Hostel application: <br>Before letting a student to apply, the system should confirm their identity and determine whether they qualify for accommodation application based on the KTDI merits and year of study. This application is only opened to the senior year students.

- KTDI college merit calculator: <br>The fellows could manage and collect the student college merits based on the college activities that participated by them. The final report on students' college merit marks will be generated automatically. Whoever meet the minimum requirement of college merit marks will be given the priorities to apply KTDI hostel.

- Room allocation: <br>According on the students' choices, room availability and KTDI merits, the automated system can assign rooms to them using the room allocation tool. The system should include elements including the student's academic programme, year of study and any unique requirements or requests, such as health condition in order to take note in the allocation process. This process will prioritise the students with higher hostel merits to prefer their desired available hostel block as well as room number. The system should provide a calendar view of the real time room availability and assist students to select their preferred room and check-in and check-out dates.

- Room management: <br>The room management feature allows students to manage their rooms through the system. This includes room changing, room cancellation, check-in, check-out and all of these will be done via online. It should also allow students to request maintenance services for their room and track the status of the request. This system also allow students to register their brought electrical appliances and the KTDI staff or administrative can always control the room of each student.

- Payment management: <br>Students can use the system to pay their lodging costs via the payment management tool. The system should enable students to monitor their payment history and receipts and offer safe payment options like internet banking and also convinence payment method, such as TnG e-wallet and duitnow QR code. The payment will include the fees of room rentaling, charges in extra electical appliances as well as the sumon given by KTDI staff.

- User management: <br>Administrators can manage user accounts for students, staff and other users via the user management tool. To make sure that users only have access to the functions and information they required, the system offers capabilities like account creation, modification and deletion as well as role-based access control.

- Security: <br>To log in the system, the students have to enter their UTM id and the password set. Same concept will be implemeted for the KTDI staff, fellows and KTDI administrators.

- Reporting and analytics: <br>Administrators will be allowed to monitor and analyze the occupancy rates, revenue and maintenance issues of the accommodation system. Reports from the system should include occupancy rates based on the study programme or room type, revenue by time period and building or room-specific maintenance issues.

- Support and maintenance: <br>Residents or students should be able to report problems any problem faced in the accommodation system, such as bugs through the system's help desk and there should be a dedicated team working to quickly resolve these problems.

- The system will be limited to Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) only and the decision phase of the final result on room application will be done by the AIMS system of UTM. Also, the data privacy and security of the users maybe a concern as our proposed system will not cover it.

### 5. Software Process Model
  
Software process model in developing the Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) project's student accommodation system is to create a user friendly and high-quality system within the allotted time and budget which fulfils our stakeholders' requirements. Therefore, we have decided to employ the <b>Agile methodology</b> as our software development process model in order to accomplish our proposed system. This method places a focus on cooperation and participation from stakeholders throughout the development process, creating a system that is more adaptable and responsive.

Furthermore, because of the nature of student rooms and development flexibility as well as continuous team collaboration, the Agile methodology is perfect for projects like ours where requirements and priorities may change frequently. Agile methodology allows us to guarantee that the system is continually updated and enhanced depending on inputs from stakeholders while our project progress moves forward. This will enable the Student Accommodation System in KTDI project to produce a system that always satisfies their changing needs and reaches the expectations.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/proposal/submission/sec01/stakeholder/diagram/agile.PNG" width="500px" height="410px"></p>

Agile methodology for developing the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) as stated below:

1. _**Planning Phase:**_ The project scope, objectives and also related stakeholders in this project are identified. This will also include the timeline and milestones, identify project risks and allocate project resources appropriately. The team developes a blueprint to foresee the final system and upcoming challenges. The ghant chart is created so the project progress or task progress of each member will always be on the track and follow the timeline set. This phase only takes 1 week of time and will be lead by the project manager to control all the activities. 

2. _**Requirements Gathering Phase:**_ The project requirement analyst team works with the indentified stakeholders to identify and prioritise user requirements of student accommodation system. The team will develop user stories and create the product as backlog items. The team then identifies acceptance criteria for each user story and break down user stories into smaller tasks, which are then added to the sprint backlog. The project development team and the stakeholders then meet to review and finalise the sprint backlog to get a complete system requirements. This phase takes 1 week in order to carry out the interview session with the stakeholders and keep in touch with them for the latest requirements. The requirement analysis will in charge of the collection and documentation of requirements for the project.

3. _**Design Phase:**_ In this phase, the system designer and the main developer lead works with the development team to develop a high-level software architecture design of the system. The team identifies and designs the database schema, creates detailed design documents and develops wireframes and prototypes for the user interface. The design is then reviewed with the development team and the stakeholders and any necessary changes are made later. After this phase, the structure and the architecture of the system designed is developed clearly. It will take 2 weeks in this phase and the UI/UX system designer and the main developer take the vital role in giving out designed architecture and overseeing the progress schedule.

4. _**Development Phase:**_ The development team begins and collaborates to develop the software components according to the sprint backlog. The team conducts code reviews to ensure code quality, write unit tests and perform unit testing. Updating of code documentation and conducting daily stand-up meetings are nesscessary to discuss progress, address any issues or roadblocks as well as plan for the next day of work. This phase takes 4 weeks to implement and the tasks will be took charge by the developer team and the main developer will become the leader in carrying out the backend works, while fontend works will lead by the user interface or user experience designer. The proposed website for KTDI student accommodation system will be fully developed after this phase.

5. _**Testing Phase:**_ To make sure the software corresponds to specified standards, the development team has to develop a testing plan and carry out functional, integration and acceptability testing. Any flaws discovered during testing will be reported and fixed using a bug tracking programme to ensure that our software is of the greatest quality and meets the user requirements. This phase will take around 2 weeks because it is the most crucial phase for developing our system. The quality assurance analyst will take charge in managing these activities and a user required website with no technical errors will be successfully developed.

6. _**Deployment Phase:**_ Our project manager will collaborate with the development team during the deployment phase of our student accommodation system for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) project to guarantee the programme is prepared for use. Final testing will be done to ensure the programme complies with all stakeholder criteria. To ensure the system runs smoothly, our team will train the stakeholders on how to use the programme and provide continuous support. We are aware of how crucial a successful deployment is and will collaborate closely with our project manager and software development team to make sure the move to the production environment goes smoothly. We estimate 2 weeks for the deployment as we need to make sure the system is fully stabilized and can run properly and it will be take charged by the project manager and the developers.
 
7. _**Review and maintenance phase:**_ The finished programme will be examined by the website developers and the stakeholders in the review phase part to make sure it really satisfies the acceptance criteria and user needs. To ensure that the final product meets the stakeholder's expectations, this phase requires ongoing stakeholder feedback. This feedback will assist the development team in both improving the system and ensuring that it satisfies the requirements of system users, resulting in a product of excellent quality. Review needs just 2 weeks because the team need to collect some of feedback from our stakeholders to know what the weaknesses or some problems towards our system. After receiving their feedbacks and comments, the maintenance team will start to solve the issues until it gets fully satisfactory from the users. This phase will let the IT support to guide the other team members to oversee the review and maintenance activities.

8. _**Launch Phase:**_ The launch phase displays the completed or finalised product that will be used in a real-world setting. Final testing and quality assurance will be carried out before the system software is launched by the project manager in collaboration with the development team to guarantee that the software is reliable and usable in a real-world setting. Following the software's deployment, on-going support will be offered to make sure the system keeps up with the demands and goals of the stakeholders. This will take just around 1 week to make sure all of it fulfill all of the stakeholders desires and to expose our final developed system to be used by our stakeholders. In this phase, all the members will be involved.

### 7. System Architecture
  
#### System Architecture Overview:
The proposed architecture for the student accommodation system project at Kolej Tun Dr Ismail will use a 3-Tier Architecture which consist of three layers: the presentation layer, the application layer and the data layer.
 
- Presentation Layer: <br>The presentation layer is the front-end of the system that users will interact with. It will consist of a web-based user interface built using the ReactJS as the font-end JavaScript library and designed by Bootstrap framework with HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as well as JavaScript. The presentation layer then will be responsible for presenting the data to the users and allowing them to interact with the well designed system in order to have a better user experience.
    
- Application Layer: <br>In this middle layer of the system, there are web server and server-side component which is the back-end of the system. Apache HTTP server will be used as the web server software to handle the HTTP requests and responses between the users and the web-based front-end via a browser. PHP server scripting language will be used on user requests handling, performing business logic and data processing as well as delivering the required data to the font-end system. It will be responsible for processing requests from the front-end and communicating with the data layer. We decided to use a server-side technology, PHP Laravel framework to help us to create extensible PHP-based web application with ease. It is also automated in testing and debugging errors in initial stage.
    
- Data Layer: <br>In this layer consists of the database system, we will use MySQL database management system to store and manage the data of user information and other related data. The data layer will be responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.
    

#### Data Storage and Management:
MySQL will be used as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store and manage the website data. All the data collected will be stored and organised in the form of table which representing a specific type of data such as maintainance records, student records, room records and accommodation application records. 
  
#### Hardware and Software Requirements:
Hardware and software requirements are crucial components of our proposed system architecture. Managing the KTDI's student accomodation system's hardware and software requirements could be done as follows:

i. Hardware requirements 
- A computer with a processor of at least 2 GHz or higher.
- A minimum of 16 GB RAM.
- Sufficient storage space to store the system files and database.
- A stable internet connection.
  
ii. Software requirements 
- ReactJS as the font-end JavaScript library for development of interactive website user interface.
- Bootstrap as the framework used for web application creation.
- MySQL as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store and manage the data.
- Apache HTTP Server as the web server software.
- PHP Laravel framework as the server-side technology.
- D3.js and Chart.js as the data visualization library to create interactive charts and present data.
- Git for version control.
- Microsoft Excel as data analysis tools to preprocess the data.
- Tableau and PowerBI as the business intelligence (BI) tools to create insights from the data.
  
#### Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Data analysis tools: <br>We will use Microsoft Excel to clean and preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis and also create data models.
- Data visualisation tools: <br>We will use D3.js and Chart.js to create interactive charts and graph to visualise room type applicable based on hostel merit in a meaningful and attractive way.
- Business intelligence (BI) tools: <br>We will use Tableau, PowerBI to perform advanced analytics, create reports and generate insights from the data.

### 8. Risks Assessment

A project, programme, or organization's potential risks must be identified, evaluated, and prioritised as part of the risk assessment process. It is a crucial component of risk management, which seeks to reduce the likelihood and effect of prospective dangers. Both quantitative and qualitative ways of expressing the outcomes of this procedure are possible. To help minimise any potential risk-related repercussions, risk assessment is a necessary component of a larger risk management plan.

The risk assessments that related to the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) are:

- User adoption risk: 
  - User adoption and commitment are the key to make the Student Accommodation System to be succeeded. The Student Accommodation System will not provide the desired benefits if staff and students are not using it efficiently. 

- Changes in project requirement:
  - Scope creep: As project requirements change over time, the project's scope will be extended, which could cause delays or the budget to be exceeded.
  - Incomplete or inaccurate specifications could lead to a poorly designed of Student Accomodation System that doesn't satisfy the needs or expectations of the users.
  - Conflicts among the Stakeholders: Stakeholders will have different ideas and needs, which can lead to the conflicts that will cause the decision-making of stakeholders become slower.

- Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>Technical problems that happened in Student Accommodation System would include hardware breakdowns, software glitches, and system outages, which can lead to system downtime, data loss, or system crashes.
  - Financial risk: <br>The Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) needs a lot of money to implement and operate, and it's impossible to use the small income to cover those large amounts of costs.
 
To mitigate these risks, the following strategies will be employed:

- User adoption risk: 
  - Users can be trained and supported. The surveys and feedback sessions will be held to improve the Student Accomodation System and incentives or rewards can be given to users who successfully adopt and use the system. These are all the actions that can help to reduce the risks associated with user adoption.

- Changes in project requirement:
  - The project requirements should be precisely stated, completed, and well-documented.
  - Create a change management strategy that show details on how modifications to the project scope will be handled, including what will be documented, reviewed, and approved.
  - To prevent conflicts, effectively communicate changes to the project's requirements to all parties involved, including the project team, users, and management.ALL parties that involved, inlcuding the project team, users, software engineer, survey team, project budget must communicate effectively to discuss the project requirements so that conflicts will not happened.

- Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>For Student Accommodation System, Kolej Tun Dr Ismail(KTDI) should put in place routine data backups and disaster recovery plans, as well as routine maintenance,software and hardware updates to reduce the technical risks. They should also employ qualified Information Technology Specialist to run and maintain the system.
  - Financial risk: <br>To reduce financial risks, they should create a thorough financial strategy that takes into consideration the initial expenditures as well as recurring expenses of the Student Accommodation System. It's important to regularly examine and modify financial predictions to take any changes in enrollment or other monetary issues into consideration.

In general, it's necessary to identify and reduce these risks if we want the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) to be more successful. We can reduce any negative effects and increase the advantages of the system by taking a proactive approach to risk management.

### 10. Technical Specifications
- Data Sources:<br>Data on students registration, room allocation, payment transactions, room management and communication logs may need to be gathered and stored by the system. These data sources might include a mix of streamed data from payment management and structured data from databases that will be collect from students based on their UTM id and they can update their profile before they select their room at KTDI.

  
- Data Schema:<br>The system's required functionality, such as centralised dashboard,students registration, payment processing, room allocation, room management, security, user management and reporting and analytics should be supported by the data schema. The schema ought to be created to make it simple to access and retrieve the data.

  
- Data Transformations:<br> In order to guarantee the data's accuracy, consistency and completeness, the system might need to alter it. Validating payment transactions, updating room availability, and producing reports are a few examples of transformations. A number of technologies, including computer languages like JavaScript, R, and MySQL,Bootstrap function as the framework to design our system for KTDI and it could be used to do these modifications.

  
- Machine Learning Algorithms:<br> The KTDI Student Accommodation System may not immediately benefit from the use of machine learning methods. However, the system could use UTM portal as web based program to assign rooms in accordance with student preferences and accessibility.

  
- Data Visualization Tools:<br> For the management team to receive insights or trends, the system may need to produce data visualisations. These visualisations could show patterns in maintenance requests, payment transaction trends, or occupancy rates. To make these visualisations, one may use programmes like Tableau or Power BI.
  
- Programming Languages, Frameworks and Libraries:<br>Developers utilise Bootstrap as framework, PHP for the backend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with React for the frontend and D3.js with Chart.js for data processing and visualisation for the Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) student accommodation system. These technologies are helpful to developers since they are well-documented and frequently used in the field.
  
- Hardware and software requirements
 <ul>i. Hardware Requirements:<br>
  •	A computer with a processor of at least 2 GHz or higher<br>
  •	A minimum of 16 GB RAM<br>
  •	Sufficient storage space to store the system files and database<br>
  •	A stable internet connection</ul>
  
 <ul>ii. Software Requirements:<br>
  •	An operating system such as Windows, Linux, or macOS<br>
  •	A code editor such as Visual Studio Code and Bootstrap Studio</ul>
  
- Data security:<br> Several steps that can be taken to ensure the security of the Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) Student Accommodation System, including secure login procedures, data encryption, routine backups and disaster recovery plans.For example,We can ask them to create the best and strong possible password in order to protect their data to be leak by irresponsible parties. The most recent security patches for software and applications should be continuously updated to fix vulnerabilities. Users should be instructed on the best data security practises, which a user guideline will be provided by us and the system can be protected by putting in place physical security measures.

- Testing procedures:
  1. Before the development of system, we have conducted a requirements gathering session or interviewing session with our stakeholders to identify and figure out the needs and features we are going to implement in the software system. It involves collecting and analyzing information from the stakeholders.
  2. Prototype: The system is made and tested for the operation and usability. It is to identify the problems at the early stage and also provide a progress of our developed system to the stakeholders.
  3. Test and run: Test and run is crucial before the system is implemented actually among the customers. It can help the software engineers to find out the possible problem and bugs during the development phase. Example： unit testing, system testing, acceptance testing.
  4. User satisfactory and tracking: Track the bugs during the implementation and installation and make improvement and enhancement towards these problems or provide a solution.
    
- Quality assurance:
  1. User maintenance tracking system: To help to provide support and maintenance when client is having problems while using the system. This also includes the updatation of the system.
  2. Documentation: To make sure everything runs smoothly based on the document prepared and easy to be understood for the client. This documents include design, code and testing procedures.
