### 1. Executive Summary
We expect to improve the design of the current existing Student Attendance Management System without changing too much of its root design. The improved attendance management system will face fewer bugs, implement a new alternative way for students to mark their attendance, location based check-ins, biometric authentication, and generate a table to ease the management of attendance for lecturers. The scope of the project includes attendance tracking, reporting and analytics, integration with other systems, mobile accessibility, security,and customization. The proposed software process model for this project is agile methodology.

### 2. Background:
In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, including education. Digital attendance management systems are widely used in educational institutions to manage student attendance. For example, UTM uses UTM Digital to track and manage student attendance. However, some features are inefficient, and fail to meet the needs of modern-day educational institutions.
The proposed digital student attendance management system aims to address the weaknesses of the existing attendance systems by providing an efficient and effective way to manage student attendance. The software will be designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to use, allowing teachers and administrators to manage attendance with ease.
The proposed software will enable lecturers to take attendance quickly and easily using a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The system will also provide real-time attendance reports, allowing teachers and administrators to monitor attendance trends and take corrective action as needed.
The benefits of the proposed system are numerous. The software will improve accuracy and reliability, reduce the workload of teachers, and provide a more comprehensive and efficient way to manage attendance. Moreover, the system will identify areas for improvement, leading to better student engagement.

### 3. Objectives:
Identify the existing bugs and inefficiencies in the current system, which will be addressed in the new design.
<ol><li><b>Implement new attendance marking options:</b></li><ul>
 <li>In addition to the current attendance marking system using QR codes, alternative methods such as typing in a line of random generated code should be an option for students in case their device faces camera issues.</li></ul>
<li><b>Implement location based check-ins:</b></li><ul> 
<li>Students are often able to mark their attendance without actually attending the class through the help of their friends. With the implementation of location based check-ins, we can ensure  the students that have marked their location are actually attending the class.</li></ul>
<li><b>Implement biometric authentication:</b> </li><ul>
<li>Biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning. This helps to prevent attendance fraud and increase accuracy.</li></ul>
<li><b>Generate a table:</b></li><ul>
<li>Records the attendance of the students, displays their attending time in order, and highlights students who are late to class. The table eases the management of student attendance for the lecturers.</li></ul></ol>


### 4. Scope: 
The scope of this project includes attendance tracking, reporting and analytics, integration with other systems, mobile accessibility, security, and customization.
 <li>The system allows teachers to track and record student attendance.</li> 
<li>The system provides insights into attendance patterns, and visualisations that can be used by lecturers to ease decision making.</li>  
<li>The system is able to integrate with other university systems such as the student information system and the learning management system.</li>  
<li>The system is accessible from mobile devices, to ease the attendance submission process.</li>  
<li>The system has strong data security measures to protect studentâ€™s data and prevent unauthorised access.</li>  
<li>The system is easily customisable to meet the specific requirements of the university, such as class schedules.</li> 


### 5. Software Process Model:
The ideal software process model for the development of UTM Student Attendance Management System is Agile methodology.
Agile Methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation. It is suitable for this project as it enables us to respond quickly to changes and deliver working software early and often.

<li>User Interface: UTM Smart to allow users to interact with our system.It lets students, teachers, and administrators view attendance data and mark attendance.</li>
<li>Application Server: The application server runs the system's logic, handles data processing, communicates with other system components, and manages the database.</li>
<li>Database: Stores attendance-related data such as student information and attendance records, and is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.</li>
<li>Authentication and Authorization: Verifies user identity and permissions.</li>
<li>Integration with Other Systems: The student attendance system may integrate with other systems, such as student information systems. This component data sharing seamlessly between the student attendance system and other systems.</li>
<li>Reporting and Analytics: The reporting and analytics component offers attendance insights and tools for generating reports and visualisations.</li>

### 8. Risks Assessment:
<ol><li>Stakeholder issues such as low engagement and inaccurate expectations</li>
<ul>
<li>Time allocated for us to communicate with the stakeholders is not enough as we have different schedules.It is difficult for us to have a meeting at the same time. Hence,the stakeholder might interact with us via social media such as Whatsapp and Email. Thus, the stakeholder may misunderstand what we want to deliver and cause inaccurate expectations.</li>
</ul>
<li>Technical risk</li>
<ul>
<li>System failures or data corruption.These problems may arise due to software/hardware failure,database management and network.</li>
</ul>
<li>User acceptance risk</li>
<ul>
<li>Target users may refuse to provide their personal data that is necessary for attendance records. As examples,name and matrics number.</li>
<li>Users prefer the previous version of the system.</li>
</ul>
<li>Security risk</li> 
<ul><li>This system consists of studentsâ€™ data.Thus exists risk of data lost due to hacking, phishing or data breaches.</li></ul>
<li>Data Quality</li>
<ul><li>Data entry error, system glitches may provide wrong information to the users.</li></ul>
<li>Implementation risk</li>
<ul>
<li>Cost overruns</li>
<li>Difficulties integrating the system with school systems and processes.</li>
</ul>

### 12. Conclusion:
  In conclusion, the recommended UTM Student Attendance Management System is designed to improve the existing system as there are some weaknesses or bugs. Such problems are students can scan the attendance without attending the actual lecture, leading to fake data received by lecturers. This will indirectly affect studentâ€™s academic performance and preferences. The modified system intends to improve the accuracy of the data, efficiency of the system and better management of studentâ€™s attendance data. To add on, the recommended system can increase the satisfaction of lecturers, enhance productivity and an overall  more dependable system.

  However, there are also issues and challenges when doing and implementing this system. For example, technical issues like sometimes the system may fail due to software/hardware failure and network connection problems and this will cause the lecturer canâ€™t access the QR code for the student to scan their attendance on time. As a result, this problem will affect the accuracy and consistency of the data and corrupt the data in the system.

  We encourage the decision-makers to consider this proposal and approve the project, as this mostly benefits lecturers and students who are the most important role to symbolise a university. With this improved system, the users will face less issues and bugs.
