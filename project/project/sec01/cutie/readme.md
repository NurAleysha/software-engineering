# Student Management System

## Introduction
  In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, including education. Digital attendance management systems are widely used in educational institutions to manage student attendance. For example, UTM uses UTM Digital to track and manage student attendance. However, some features are inefficient and fail to meet the needs of modern-day educational institutions.
The proposed digital student attendance management system aims to address the weaknesses of the existing attendance systems by providing an efficient and effective way to manage student attendance. The software will be designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to use, allowing teachers and administrators to manage attendance with ease.
The proposed software will enable lecturers to take attendance quickly and easily using a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The system will also provide real-time attendance reports, allowing teachers and administrators to monitor attendance trends and take corrective action as needed.
The benefits of the proposed system are numerous. The software will improve accuracy and reliability, reduce the workload of teachers, and provide a more comprehensive and efficient way to manage attendance. Moreover, the system will identify areas for improvement, leading to better student engagement.

#### Objective
  We aim to identify the existing bugs and inefficiencies in the current system, which will be addressed in the new design.
<ol><li><b>Implement new attendance marking options:</b></li><ul>
 <li>In addition to the current attendance marking system using QR codes, alternative methods such as typing in a line of randomly generated code should be an option for students in case their device faces camera issues.</li></ul>
<li><b>Implement location-based check-ins:</b></li><ul> 
<li>Students are often able to mark their attendance without actually attending the class through the help of their friends. With the implementation of location-based check-ins, we can ensure  the students that have marked their location are actually attending the class.</li></ul>
<li><b>Implement biometric authentication:</b> </li><ul>
<li>Biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning. This helps to prevent attendance fraud and increase accuracy.</li></ul>
<li><b>Generate a table:</b></li><ul>
<li>Records the attendance of the students, displays their attending time in order, and highlights students who are late to class. The table eases the management of student attendance for the lecturers.</li></ul></ol>
  This project holds significant potential impact by saving time, reducing errors, and providing real-time attendance data for effective decision making.

</li>

<li><b>UI/UX Design : </b><br>
Our team had conducted user research to understand the needs and preferences of different user groups. Low-fidelity wireframes using sticky notes to visualize the basic layout and functionality of the user interface had been created. Then, we incorporated feedback from our stakeholders and users to iteratively improve the UI design. The low-fidelity wireframes are then translated into high-fidelity designs using the Figma design tool. Collaboration with the development team had ensured that the UI designs were implementable.

#### Software Components/Modules Developed
##### User Interface (UI) Module
The UI module is responsible for providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the Attendance System. It includes features such as login/authentication screens, attendance recording forms, report generation interfaces, and administrative setting panels. The UI module undergoes two stages of development: low fidelity and high fidelity.

1.1	Low Fidelity UI:
In the earlier stages of development, The UI module utilizes low fidelity designs. These designs are basic wireframes or sketches that outline the structure, layout and flow of the user interface. The wireframes are sketched on sticky notes so that it can be rearranged on a board or a wall.

1.2	High Fidelity UI:
In later stages of development, the UI module transitions to high fidelity designs created using the Figma design tool. Figma provides a digital design environment that allows designers to create polished and visually appealing interfaces. High fidelity UI designs in Figma incorporate detailed visual elements, typography and colors.

##### Authentication Module:
The authentication module handles user authentication and security within the Attendance System. It includes functionalities such as login, password management, and access control. The module ensures secure access to the system, encrypts sensitive information, and manages user sessions.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
#### <b>Testing Strategies and Techniques</b>
We had employed a combination of manual and automated testing strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the Attendance System.Test-driven development (TDD) approach was followed, where test cases were created before writing the actual code. This helped in driving the development process and ensuring that the code met the specified requirements.

#### <b>Types of testing conducted</b><br><br>
1)User Acceptance Testing (UAT):<br>
Stakeholders and end-users were involved in UAT to validate the system’s usability, functionality, and adherence to their requirements. Feedback from UAT sessions was collected and incorporated into the system’s refinement.<br><br>
2)Usability Testing:<br>
The team conducted usability tests to evaluate the ease of use and intuitiveness of the user interface. Feedback from users was collected to identify any usability issues and make iterative improvements to the system’s design.<br><br>
3)Integration Testing:<br>
The integration of various modules was tested to ensure proper communication and data flow between them. Integration tests were performed to verify the interaction of backend APIs with the frontend user interface.

#### <b>Quality Assurance Processes</b><br><br>
1)Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:<br>
Comprehensive documentation was maintained to provide guidelines for testing procedures, test cases, and quality assurance processes. This documentation served as a reference for future maintenance and enhancement activities and ensured knowledge sharing among team members.<br><br>
2)Prototype Validation:<br>
The team regularly shared low-fidelity prototypes and design mock-ups with stakeholders and users for validation and feedback. THis process helped identify design flaws, usability issues, and potential improvements early on.<br><br>
3)Peer Review and Collaboration:<br>
The team promoted a collaborative environment where members reviewed each other’s work, provided constructive feedback, and ensured adherence to project goals and standards.<br><br>
4)Project Evaluation:<br>
At the end of the project, the team conducted a comprehensive evaluation to assess the overall success of the project. This involved reviewing project objectives, stakeholder feedback, and any quantitative or qualitative data collected during the testing phase.



## Results and Archievements
### User Satisfaction:
Feedback from stakeholders and users has been overwhelmingly positive. Through user testing and feedback sessions, the project team gathered valuable insights that guided the system’s development. Users have expressed satisfaction with the system’s ease of use and intuitive interface.
### Data Analysis and Reporting:
The Attendance Management System includes reporting and analytics capabilities, enabling administrators to generate comprehensive attendance reports. These reports provide valuable insights into attendance trends, patterns, and statistics, supporting data-driven decision-making and resource planning.
### Stakeholder Engagement:
Throughout the project’s evaluation process, stakeholders have actively engaged with the project team. Their involvement and feedback have been instrumental in shaping the system’s features, ensuring it aligns with their specific needs and requirements.
### Enhanced Accuracy:
The implementation of biometric and location verification mechanisms in the Attendance System has significantly improved the accuracy of attendance records. By requiring students to physically scan their biometrics (fingerprints or facial recognition) and verifying their location, the system ensures that attendance is marked only when students are physically present in the designated area.
### Prevention of Attendance Fraud:
The use of biometric and location verification has effectively prevented attendance fraud. Students are unable to scan their attendance from elsewhere or have someone else mark attendance on their behalf, as the system verifies their identity and location in real-time.
### Increased Accountability:
With the implementation of biometric and location verification as stated above, students are held accountable for their attendance. The system promotes a sense of responsibility and discourages absenteeism or attempts to cheat the attendance system, as each student’s presence is verified through their unique biometric information and location
