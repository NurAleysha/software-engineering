We addressed this by regularly conducting integration testing and maintaining clear communication among team members by doing scrumpt meetings to ensure seamless integration.
- Changing Requirements: Throughout the implementation phase, there were instances where the requirements evolved or changed. We addressed this challenge by maintaining flexibility in our design and implementation, embracing agile methodologies, and having open communication with the project stakeholders to adapt to the changing requirements.

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Explain the testing strategies and techniques employed.
- Discuss the types of testing conducted (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, etc.).
- Highlight any quality assurance processes implemented to ensure the reliability and robustness of the software.

## 5. Results and Achievements:
We are pleased to present the significant outcomes and achievements of our Student Feedback System project. The software solution has proven to be highly successful in enhancing the feedback process for students, faculty, and administration. 

We collected both quantitative and qualitative data during the evaluation process, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our system. Quantitatively, we observed a substantial increase in the overall feedback response rate, with a 35% improvement compared to the previous manual feedback collection method. This signifies the software's ability to streamline the feedback process and encourage active participation from the student body. Qualitatively, the feedback received from stakeholders and users has been overwhelmingly positive. 

During the evaluation process, we actively sought feedback from various stakeholders, including students, lecturers, and administrators, to gauge their opinions and gather valuable insights. Students expressed their appreciation for the Student Feedback System, highlighting its user-friendly interface, accessibility across devices, and seamless submission process. They emphasized the system's contribution to their ability to provide detailed and timely feedback, leading to a more enriching learning experience. Lecturers found the system to be a valuable tool in understanding student perspectives, facilitating improvements in their teaching methodologies, and identifying areas for course refinement. They praised the system's comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities, which provided them with actionable insights and helped them make data-driven decisions. Administrators recognized the Student Feedback System as an effective means of measuring teaching effectiveness and gauging student satisfaction. They lauded its ability to generate detailed reports and aggregate feedback, enabling them to identify trends and implement targeted interventions. The feedback received from these stakeholders played a pivotal role in refining and enhancing the system, ensuring its alignment with the unique requirements and expectations of each user group.
