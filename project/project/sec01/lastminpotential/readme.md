## Introduction
<b>Purpose and objective:</b>
<p>The purpose of a faculty feedback system is <m>to gather input and evaluations from students and staff members about their experiences with faculty from different perspective</m> such as curriculum delivery, facilities and equipment.The system serves as a structured mechanism for students and faculty staff members to provide constructive feedback and share their perspectives on various aspects of the learning environment. The main objective of this system is <m>quality improvement to enhance the quality of the learning and teaching environment</m> by identifying areas that require improvement.</p>

<b>Problem statement or the need the project aims to address:</b>
<p>The project aims to address the need for a reliable and effective faculty feedback system in educational institutions. The problem statement revolves around the issues such as lack of user input. Without a structured feedback system, students or faculty staff may not have a formal channel to express their opinions, concerns, and suggestions regarding the learning environment. This lack of user input can hinder the faculty's ability to understand and meet students' and faculty members' needs, leading to potential dissatisfaction or disengagement.

The next issue is quality enhancement. The Faculty of Computing strives to provide a high-quality learning environment, but without a feedback system, it becomes challenging to assess the effectiveness of faculty and identify areas that require improvement. A comprehensive feedback system helps identify strengths and weaknesses, enabling targeted interventions and support for faculty development to enhance the quality of learning and teaching environment.
