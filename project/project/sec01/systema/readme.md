Overall, the development of the student engagement website aims to create a comprehensive platform that supports students throughout their academic journey, enhances their learning experience, and fosters a sense of community within the Faculty Computing community.  

### Problem statement or the need the project aims to address  
The project aims to address the need for enhancing the overall student experience and improving student engagement within the academic community of the Faculty of Computing at University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). With the increasing prevalence of digital technologies in the education sector, there is a demand for leveraging these technologies to provide a more personalized, interactive, and engaging learning experience for students.

The problem statement revolves around the following aspects:

1. Limited student engagement: The existing system may lack effective means for students to engage with course-specific information, connect with peers and faculty members, and stay updated on important academic events and deadlines.

2. Fragmented communication: Communication and collaboration within the academic community may be scattered, making it challenging for students, faculty, and staff to effectively communicate and share information.

3. Lack of personalized support: Students may face difficulties in accessing relevant information and resources tailored to their individual needs and interests, which can impact their learning experience.

4. Low student retention and satisfaction: Insufficient student engagement and satisfaction levels may contribute to higher dropout rates and lower overall student retention.

By developing a student engagement website with features like a personalized dashboard, course-specific forums, a student directory, and a feedback system, the project aims to address these issues. The website will serve as a central hub for students to access information, connect with their peers and faculty members, and receive personalized support. Ultimately, the project aims to improve student retention, academic outcomes, and the overall sense of community within the Faculty Computing community.
