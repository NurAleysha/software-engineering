**Purpose**:
The purpose of the Student Accommodation System project is to develop a web application software system that streamlines and integrates the management and application process for student accommodations at Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The system aims to provide a more efficient and convenient experience for UTM students and KTDI staff.

**Problem Statement**:
The existing accommodation application and management process at KTDI is time-consuming, prone to mistakes, and lacks integration. Students face difficulties in applying for accommodations and selecting suitable rooms as well as are frustrated with the long process of room action application, while staff struggle with manual room allocation and record-keeping.

**Significant Impact**:
1. Improved Student Satisfaction: Simplifying the application process and enabling room selection based on preferences enhances the student experience and satisfaction.
2. Enhanced Staff Efficiency: Automating room allocation and providing centralized access to data reduces administrative burdens and improves staff productivity.
3. Reduced Errors and Delays: Automation and streamlined communication minimize errors, eliminate delays, and improve overall efficiency.
4. Optimal Resource Allocation: Data analysis capabilities enable informed decision-making, optimizing the allocation of accommodations and resources.
5. Positive University Reputation: A well-functioning accommodation system demonstrates a commitment to student welfare and enhances the university's reputation, attracting more students.

## Methodology

To develop the Student Accommodation System for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), we have chosen the **Agile methodology** as our software development process model. The aim is to create a user-friendly and high-quality system within the allocated time and budget, while meeting the requirements of our stakeholders.

1. Agile Methodology: We adopt the Agile methodology, which emphasizes cooperation and active stakeholder participation throughout the development process.
2. Adaptability and Responsiveness: The Agile approach suits the project's dynamic nature, enabling flexibility and continuous collaboration to accommodate changing requirements and priorities.
3. Iterative Development: We employ iterative development cycles, breaking the project into manageable increments to deliver value in each iteration.
4. Continuous Improvement: The Agile process promotes continuous improvement, with regular feedback loops and opportunities for refinement and adjustment.
5. Stakeholder Engagement: Stakeholders are actively involved, providing input, feedback, and validation at different stages to ensure the system meets their evolving needs and expectations.

By utilizing the Agile methodology, we can effectively address the unique aspects of student accommodations, including the need for development flexibility and ongoing team collaboration. The Agile approach allows us to continually update and enhance the system based on stakeholder inputs, ensuring that the Student Accommodation System evolves to meet their changing needs and surpass their expectations.
