## Introduction
### 1. Purpose
THe purpose of our project of building a KTDI Event Management System is aimed to simplify and streamline the processes of event management held by KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM) at UTM Johor. The system offers a variety of key features that assist our stakeholders, JKM KTDI, KTDI staff members, as well as the students around UTM Johor, in respective tasks for event preparation and post-activity processes. 

### 2. Objective
1. To develop a KTDI Event Management System that is simple to use, which includes multiple functions like calendar for events in a semester, task delegation, and automated merit point record.
2. To enhance communication and information access by providing a centralised platform for students to view event details and register for activities that they are interested in.
3. To help JKM KTDI to track the number of student registrations for events through the system.
4. To provide comprehensive training and support to users of the system (JKM KTDI, KTDI staff members, UTM students) to ensure successful implementation. 

### 3. Problem Statement
1. One of the many problems faced by JKM KTDI is the crashing of event dates, due to manual event preparation processes. 
2. Besides, they will need to conduct multiple meetings to ensure team progression, which can be time-consuming.
3. Furthermore, JKM KTDI is also required to manually compute the merit points of KTDI students, which determines their active quota for priority in booking the hostel for the upcoming semester. 
4. On the contrary, students often encounter difficulties in finding college events due to the overwhelming number of events being shared on social meida platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

### 4. Potential Impact
1. Avoid clashing of events via the event calendar and to view upcoming events held in KTDI.
2. Task delegation for JKM KTDI.
3. Tracking of students' registration, attendance and feedback for the events.
4. Automatic update of KTDI merit points.
