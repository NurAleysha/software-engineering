The Authentication Subsystem handles the authentication and authorization process for the KTDI Minimart System. It allows users, including customers and mini mart staff, to securely access the system and perform their designated actions based on their roles and permissions. The subsystem validates user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and verifies their authorization to access specific features and functionalities of the system. It ensures the security and integrity of user accounts and protects sensitive information.

The Ordering Subsystem facilitates the process of placing and managing orders in the KTDI Minimart System. It allows customers to browse available products, add them to their carts, and submit orders for purchase. The subsystem manages inventory availability, updates stock levels, and calculates order totals. It also provides functionality for customers to review and modify their orders before finalizing them. Additionally, the subsystem allows mini mart staff to view and process incoming orders, including order fulfillment and delivery arrangements.

The Payment Subsystem handles the secure processing of payments within the KTDI Minimart System. It integrates with payment gateways and enables customers to make online payments for their orders. The subsystem securely captures payment details, verifies payment authorization, and processes transactions in real-time. It provides customers with multiple payment options, such as credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. The subsystem ensures the confidentiality of sensitive payment information and facilitates seamless and reliable payment processing.

###The challenges faced during the implementation phase:
Time Constraints: We recognize the challenge of balancing project work with our academic commitments and deadlines.

Skill and Knowledge Gaps: We understand that we may have varying levels of technical expertise and experience. Addressing skill gaps and acquiring the necessary knowledge to implement the system can be a challenge for us.

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance:
During the implementation of the KTDI Minimart System, we paid significant attention to testing and quality assurance to ensure the system's reliability and performance. One of the techniques we employed was Equivalence Partitioning (EP), which involved dividing input data into logical groups or partitions based on similar characteristics or behavior.

For instance, we applied EP to test different categories of products, customer roles, and payment methods. By selecting representative test cases from each partition, we effectively validated the system's functionality across various scenarios.

Furthermore, we utilized Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) to test the system at the boundaries of input ranges or limits. This approach allowed us to identify and examine the system's behavior at minimum and maximum values. For example, we rigorously tested the boundaries of order quantities, product prices, and customer account balances.

By implementing EP and BVA, we ensured thorough testing coverage and addressed potential issues or edge cases that may arise. Our comprehensive testing approach also encompassed functional testing, usability testing, performance testing, security testing, and regression testing.

Throughout the implementation phase, we developed a well-defined test plan, created test cases, executed tests, and documented any identified issues or defects. This proactive approach to testing and quality assurance played a crucial role in delivering a reliable and high-quality KTDI Minimart System.


During the implementation of the KTDI Minimart System, we conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure that the system met the needs and expectations of the mini mart's management, staff, and customers.

For UAT, we involved representatives from the mini mart who actively participated in testing the system's functionality, usability, and overall user experience. They performed various tasks and scenarios that they would typically encounter while using the system in their daily operations. This allowed us to validate that the system aligned with their requirements, was intuitive to use, and met their operational needs effectively.

By incorporating UAT into our implementation process, we ensured that the KTDI Minimart System underwent real-world validation before its final deployment. The feedback and insights gathered during UAT allowed us to make necessary adjustments and refinements to enhance the system's functionality and user experience.

Overall, the successful implementation of UAT confirmed that the KTDI Minimart System was ready for deployment and met the expectations of the mini mart's management, staff, and customers
