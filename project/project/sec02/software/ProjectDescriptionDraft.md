### 2. Methodology:
- The approach and methodologies utilized to tackle the project
  - Requirement Analysis : This phase involves gathering and documenting the requirements of the Student Health and Wellness Management System. It includes identifying the key features, functionalities, and goals of the system, as well as the specific constraints.
    
  - Design : In this phase, the system's architecture and user interface are planned. The design phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the system's implementation and ensures that it aligns with the requirements gathered in the previous phase.
    
  - Development : The actual coding and implementation of the Student Health and Wellness Management System take place during this phase. The development of system uses programming languages, frameworks, and libraries to build the system's components and integrate them into a cohesive whole.
    
  - Testing : Quality assurance and testing activities are performed to identify and fix the issues in the system. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the system meets the specified requirements and functions as intended.
    
  - Deployment : Once the system has passed testing and is deemed ready for production, it is deployed to the target environment. This will involve configuring servers, databases, and other infrastructure components necessary for the system to run effectively.
    
  - Maintenance : After deployment, the Student Health and Wellness Management System requires ongoing support and maintenance including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements based on user feedback or evolving requirements.

- The software development life cycle model
  - Agile methodology : Prioritize iterative and incremental development, collaboration, and flexibility.
    
    - Scrum : Involves dividing the project into small, manageable iterations called sprints, with each sprint focusing on delivering a set of prioritized features.
