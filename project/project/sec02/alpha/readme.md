## Introduction
  The Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail College room rental system project aims to develop a web-based system that allows students to easily request and rent college rooms. The system will automatically calculate the rental price based on the type of room and the number of days the student will stay. After the application is approved, the student will then pay for the room. 

  The main goal of the system is to simplify the college room rental process and ensure timely and accurate payment processing. The system will be developed using a web-based architecture and require full-stack web development expertise. The project team will consist of a main developer, a business analyst, a quality assurance engineer, a UI/UX designer, a database administrator, and an assistant developer. The project will require workstations, a server or cloud infrastructure, and various software tools such as an IDE, front-end, web frameworks, and testing frameworks. The project will also require other expenses such as internet access and office supplies.

### Objective

- Simplifying the room rental procedure by making it easy for students to find available rooms, view details about the rooms, and complete the rental process without any trouble. The system should provide clear information about the rental terms and conditions, as well as any fees associated with the rental.
- Enhancing security by maintaining the security of user information and ensuring that the payment procedure is carried out safely.
- Streamlining administrative tasks by helping automate administrative processes like handling rental agreements, accepting payments, and producing reports.
- Improve user experience by providing a better user experience by offering features such as room choices, and user feedback. The system will ensure that any issues or concerns can be addressed in a timely manner.
