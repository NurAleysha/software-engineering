## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance:

In the project focused on developing a parcel delivery system for KTDI students at UTM, we employed a comprehensive testing approach that combined manual testing techniques with automated testing tools. The manual testing involved designing test cases based on software requirements and functions, assigning unique test case IDs, and analyzing test steps for equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. Equivalence partitioning allowed us to cover a range of input scenarios by selecting representative values from each equivalence class, while boundary value analysis helped us test the boundaries of input ranges. Additionally, we utilized automated testing tools to execute test scripts efficiently, handle repetitive or complex tests, simplify the testing process, improve test coverage, and ensure consistent test execution. Unit testing was also employed to verify the correctness and expected behavior of individual software components, catch bugs early, and ensure code reliability. To ensure the reliability and robustness of the software, we developed a comprehensive test plan, created well-defined test cases, executed tests, tracked and managed defects, generated test reports, maintained a test environment similar to production, and integrated testing into the software development process through continuous integration and deployment practices.

## 5. Results and Achievements:


We are excited to present the remarkable outcomes and accomplishments of our project focused on developing a parcel delivery system specifically tailored for KTDI students at UTM.
