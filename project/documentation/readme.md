# System Documentation
Project documentation is a critical component of software development, providing a record of the project's objectives, requirements, design, development, and testing activities. It typically includes a Project Proposal that outlines the project's goals, objectives, scope, and expected outcomes, along with a Proposal Rubric to assess the proposal's quality. The System Documentation (SD) is a detailed document that comprises the System Requirements Specification (SRS), System Design Document (SDD), and System Testing Document (STD). The SRS outlines functional and non-functional requirements, the SDD documents the software system's architecture and design, and the STD documents the testing process used to validate the software system's functionality, reliability, and performance. Together, these documents ensure that the software system meets the requirements and expectations of its users and meets the required quality standards.




## Documentation

| No | Document | Description | File | 
| :-----: | ------ | ------ | :-----: | 
| 1 | Project Proposal|A project proposal is a detailed document that outlines a proposed project's goals, scope, activities, deliverables, and proposed duration. The introduction should be neat, organized, and written in clear language, with a description of the project's main goal and scope. The software process model (SPM) used for the project should be explained along with the reason for its selection. An illustration of the SPM should be provided to help readers understand how it will be used in the project. Finally, the proposal should include detailed activities, deliverables, and proposed duration for each phase of the project. The proposal must also consider the feasibility of the project, the resources required, and any potential risks.|<a href="../../proposal/materials/guideline.md" ><img src="../../images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 2 | Proposal Rubric | A rubric for evaluating a project proposal should include criteria such as neatness, organization, and language in the introduction section. The goal and scope of the project should also be clearly defined in the introduction. The proposal should explain the software process model (SPM) selected for the project and provide a reasoning for its selection. An illustration of the SPM should be included in the proposal. The proposal should also detail the activities, deliverables, and proposed duration for each phase of the project, while considering the feasibility, resources required, and potential risks. The rubric should also assess the proposal's adherence to the required guidelines and the quality of its writing. |<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cy_X_OmlN0MI9PNEMSZasIAMD_0nilqz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116754994049085925053&rtpof=true&sd=true" ><img src="../../images/xlsx64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 3 | System Requirements Specification (SRS) | The IEEE System Requirements Specification (SRS) is a document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It provides a clear and concise overview of the system's features, user interfaces, performance, security, and usability, serving as a communication tool between stakeholders and software developers. The SRS ensures that the software system meets the requirements and expectations of its users and that it meets the required quality standards. The document follows specific guidelines and should be written using clear and concise language and appropriate notation to ensure that it is easily understood by all parties involved in the software development process. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/tree/main/project/documentation/srs" ><img src="../../images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 4 | Rubric System Requirements Specification (SRS) | A rubric for evaluating a System Requirements Specification (SRS) should include criteria such as the purpose, scope, and overview of the introduction section. The specific requirements section should include user characteristics, use case diagrams and module/functions, use case descriptions, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams. The software system attributes, performance, and other requirements should be clearly specified, along with design constraints. The rubric should assess the SRS's adherence to industry standards, completeness, consistency, and clarity of language. The SRS should also be evaluated based on its feasibility, the identification of potential risks, and the suitability of the requirements for achieving the project's objectives. |<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n0vPCpzcVQr2SplB0wEvpQi4i2GZgOQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116754994049085925053&rtpof=true&sd=true" ><img src="../../images/xlsx64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|
