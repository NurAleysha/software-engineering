<h2>Task Breakdown</h2>
  
1. Review the Acceptance Criteria:
- Refer back to the acceptance criteria defined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and ensure a clear understanding of the expected functionality and features.
- Identify any additional requirements or changes that may have emerged during the acceptance testing phase and incorporate them into implementation plan.

2. Prioritize and Break Down Tasks:
- Prioritize the implementation tasks based on their importance and impact on the overall functionality and user experience of the Student Health and Wellness System.
- Break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units. Consider using agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban boards to organize and track the progress of individual tasks.

3. Identify Development Approach:
- Select an appropriate development approach for your project, such as waterfall, agile, or a hybrid approach.
- Consider the benefits and limitations of each approach and align it with the project's requirements, team capabilities, and timeline.

4. Design and Architecture:
- Based on the SRS and acceptance criteria, create a detailed design and architecture for the mobile application.
- Define the overall structure, modules, and components of the system, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.
- Consider design patterns and best practices for mobile application development to ensure a robust and efficient implementation.

5. Agile Development Iterations:
- If adopting an agile approach, divide the implementation into iterations or sprints.
- Plan the scope of each iteration, ensuring that it aligns with the acceptance criteria and project timeline.
- Conduct regular meetings with the development team to review progress, address challenges, and gather feedback.

6. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- Implement a test-driven development approach, where tests are written before the corresponding code.
- Create unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests to ensure that the implemented features meet the defined acceptance criteria.
- Continuously run tests to validate the correctness and functionality of the developed code.

7. Version Control and Collaboration:
- Utilize a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage source code and facilitate collaboration among team members.
- Establish coding conventions and standards to maintain code consistency and readability.
- Encourage frequent code reviews and pair programming to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing within the team.

8. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
- Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- Integrate tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI to automatically build and test the application, ensuring that each code change does not introduce regressions.

9. Regular Quality Assurance:
- Conduct regular quality assurance activities throughout the implementation phase.
- Perform functional testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing to ensure that the application meets the expected standards and user requirements.

10. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:
- Maintain regular communication with stakeholders, including PKU representatives, to gather feedback, address concerns, and keep them updated on the project's progress.
- Schedule regular demos or presentations to showcase the implemented features and gather feedback for further improvements.
