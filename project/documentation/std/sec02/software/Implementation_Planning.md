<h1>Implementation Planning Draft<h1>
  
<h2>Task Breakdown</h2>
  
1. Review the Acceptance Criteria:
- Refer back to the acceptance criteria defined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and ensure a clear understanding of the expected functionality and features.
- Identify any additional requirements or changes that may have emerged during the acceptance testing phase and incorporate them into implementation plan.
- If identified any additional requirements or changes during acceptance testing phase, discuss with stakeholder and modified the system based on the requirement.

2. Prioritize and Break Down Tasks:
- Prioritize the implementation tasks based on their importance and impact on the overall functionality and user experience of the Student Health and Wellness System.
- Break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units. Consider using agile methodologies such as Scrum to organize and track the progress of individual tasks.
- Continuously update progress in Github for each members to ensure continuously improvement culture exist in the implementation of this project.
- Daily Scrum required to make sure every members understand the progress and know what to do next.

3. Identify Development Approach:
- Select an appropriate development approach for implementation of project, such as waterfall, agile, or a hybrid approach. It is highly recommended to use agile method since it is more proper method to use in this project. 
- Consider the benefits and limitations of each approach to this project and align it with the project's requirements, team capabilities, and timeline.

4. Agile Development Iterations:
- If adopting an agile approach, divide the implementation into iterations or sprints.
- Plan the scope of each iteration, ensuring that it aligns with the acceptance criteria and project timeline.
- Conduct regular meetings with the development team to review progress, address challenges, and gather feedback.

5. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- Implement a test-driven development approach, where tests are written before the corresponding code.
- Create unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests to ensure that the implemented features meet the defined acceptance criteria.
- Continuously run tests to validate the correctness and functionality of the developed code.

6. Version Control and Collaboration:
- Utilize a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage source code and facilitate collaboration among team members.
- Establish coding conventions and standards to maintain code consistency and readability.
- Encourage frequent code reviews and pair programming to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing within the team.

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
- Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- Integrate tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI to automatically build and test the application, ensuring that each code change does not introduce regressions.

8. Regular Quality Assurance:
- Conduct regular quality assurance activities throughout the implementation phase.
- Perform functional testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing to ensure that the application meets the expected standards and user requirements.

9. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:
- Maintain regular communication with stakeholders, including PKU admin, KTDI MPP and PKU Doctor to gather feedback, address concerns, and keep them updated on the project's progress.
- Schedule regular demos or presentations to showcase the implemented features and gather feedback for further improvements.
